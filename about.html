            <h3>Where we started </h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Youâ€™re probably wondering how does a company like this start? Well, it started in 2012. Well, My Name is Brooklynn, and this is my point of view. In fourth grade I was spending four hours on homework when the average kid was spending 45 minutes. My teacher started to look into my writing and saw the signs that I may have a dyslexia. 
              My parents decided to have me tested for dyslexia. The women who tested me felt when meeting me there would be nothing she could help with. After giving me the test and looking at the results, we found out that I have Dyslexia. Now what do we do? At the time we were living in Texas, which thankfully has the Orton Gillingham program in district. So, I was put in the two-year program.
              I was taken out of class every day to meet with an instructor to relearn and reteach the brain. After my mom found out I had dyslexia she wanted to test my sibling. My brother was tested, and we found out he also has dyslexia. At this time my family was preparing
              to move to Florida where there was no program for my brother. So, my mother felt like it was up to her to find a solution. She went to searching and found out that you could do the program privately, but it would cost too much per week. She went to school to get her dyslexia certificate. She led my brother thought the 
              program. This is where we got the ideas so we could be able to help others in a similar solution. Going to a school where there was not sufficed help for my learning needs. We want to be able to put the help in the homes of others. We are dedicated to helping you and your family change the perspective on the learning process!
  
            </p>
